In our logo, each line represents how much the average temperature of waters in the Bering Strait have changed. Blue highlights times when the water was colder than the monthly average, red shows warm periods. From left to right, this is a twenty year record of 2000 - 2019.

Can you see how temperatures in the arctic have warmed?

#### what are we?

The Arctic Ocean is undergoing rapid environmental shifts due to changing physical conditions, yet our ability to predict how these changes impact marine life is limited. SEAS the Change is a research initiative focused on improving ecological forecasting for the Pacific Arctic by studying how nitrogen—a key nutrient for ocean ecosystems—moves through Arctic waters and supports life at the base of the marine food web. Our team combines field observations with cutting-edge modeling to connect physical ocean changes to ecosystem responses, aiming to better understand how nutrients drive primary production and, ultimately, impact the entire food chain, from tiny plankton to large fish species.

Our work seeks to benefit _fisheries managers_, _scientists_, and _communities_ by producing detailed insights into nutrient and productivity patterns within the Northern Bering and Chukchi Seas. By developing data-driven models that forecast these changes, we can provide tools that support sustainable management of Alaska’s vital marine resources. Through community workshops and interactive tools like a real-time modeling dashboard, SEAS the Change also seeks to engage students, local stakeholders, and the wider public in understanding how Arctic ecosystems are evolving and why it matters for the future.
