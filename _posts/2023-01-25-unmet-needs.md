At the [Alaskan Marine Science Symposium](https://www.alaskamarinescience.org/) this year, we held a half-day workshop in order to poll a wide range of attendees about _unmet needs in Arctic science_. We had 20 people participate, including senior scientists, junior scientists, students, and community members. Below is a summary of our findings:

#### Summary of Findings
##### What are you excited about in Arctic research?

Improved seasonal coverage of datasets. Continuous annual data is invaluable for testing hypotheses but still extremely limited at high latitudes (e.g. sea ice, limited satellite). Field work that extends beyond the typical summer season is invaluable and exciting.

Development and deployment of new technologies (inc. models, gliders, floats) opens new avenues in Arctic research. Help alleviate some logistical and resource constraints.

Greater ecosystem integration. The field has matured well and field programs are becoming more interdisciplinary allowing us to ask questions about the entire ecosystem rather than just individual pieces.

##### What holds back Arctic research and science? What are perceived problem areas?

Access to ships is extremely limited. The US Arctic fleet is virtually non-existent and scheduling for foreign ships is competitive. We need more capacity in this region even to just continue existing programs let alone expand to new ones.

There is a lack of leadership opportunities for early and mid-career scientists. Students donâ€™t see opportunities for personal development in Arctic research and instead feel that most programs are lead by a handful of senior PIs.
T
here is an obvious lack of baseline observations in the Arctic leading to challenges in how data can be compared or how ideas can be tested.

##### What are some community action ideas so that we can overcome challenges?

Standardization of methods and datasets would be immediately useful and helpful to the community. Especially so for students since it can be difficult to find data let alone make use of it.
Getting people together is the best way to explore ideas and generate new ones. In person meetings are best when possible.

Improvements for data accessibility and retrievability would go a long way towards making Arctic research feel more open and welcoming. Currently you often just need to know who is doing what in the Arctic in order to get/find data. This reinforces the perception that only a few senior PIs are in control of Arctic research.
