#### Informed Datasets: Unmet needs and synergistic paths forward for Arctic Ocean datasets


The Arctic is presently undergoing rapid environmental change, yet baseline and process-based understandings of Arctic Ocean plankton are only just beginning to emerge from our multidisciplinary, long-term data sets. In this workshop we will (1) review the current state of biogeochemical observations in the Pacific Arctic and (2) discuss our roles in facilitating Arctic Ocean model development and evaluation. This workshop will center on identifying opportunities for collaboration and delineating current unmet needs for data sharing and analysis within the Pacific Arctic community.

This will be an annual workshop held by SEAS the Change, an NPRB funded synthesis project, seeking to build conceptual and quantitative models of nutrient supply and utilization in the Pacific Arctic. Coffee and baked goods will be provided.

09:00 – 09:15    	Welcome and Introduction
09:15 – 10:00    	Biogeochemical observations of the Arctic Distributed Biological Observatory (DBO), Nansen and Amundsen Basins Observational System (NABOS), and Satellite Oceanography
10:00 - 11:15    	Breakout Groups and Refreshments
Q1: **“How can we facilitate Arctic Ocean biogeochemical development?”**
Q2: **“What barriers inhibit this development?”**
11:15 – 12:00    	Reconvene and Report Back
